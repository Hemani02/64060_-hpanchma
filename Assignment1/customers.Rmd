## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r customers}
customers <- read.csv("customers.csv")
str(customers)
summary(customers[, c("HouseholdSize", "Income", "Spending2017", "Spending2018", "NumOfOrders", "DaysSinceLast")])
table(customers$Sex)
table(customers$Race)
table(customers$College)
table(customers$Satisfaction)
table(customers$Channel)
customers$SatBinary <- ifelse(customers$Satisfaction %in% c("Very Satisfied", "Somewhat Satisfied"),
                              "Satisfied", "Not Satisfied")
hist(customers$Income,
     main = "Histogram of Income",
     xlab = "Income", col = "skyblue", border = "black")
plot(customers$Income, customers$Spending2018,
     main = "Scatterplot of Income vs Spending2018",
     xlab = "Income", ylab = "Spending2018", pch = 19, col = "darkgreen")
```
